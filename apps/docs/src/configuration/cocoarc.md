# CLI Configurations

::: warning

CLI Configurations and code generator does not support Class Cog (both V1 and V2) yet.  
Will be supported when I want it to

:::

- messagePath: Path where message commands is

- slashPath: Path where slash commands is

## Example CLI Usage

```bash
# npm
npx cocoadu create slash ping
# yarn
yarn cocoadu create slash ping
```

For object cog only, will create a file template for a single command with that name
