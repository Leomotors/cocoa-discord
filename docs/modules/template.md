# Template

```ts
import { ... } from "cocoa-discord-utils/meta";
```

`template` is a module that contains many things to save up your time, for example

- Intents Template
- Some utilities function that can save lines of code
- `getStatusFields` that returns fancy embed fields showing the status of the bot

## CocoaIntent

`CocoaIntent` is a new utility class which will replace the old intent templates.

One of the problem of old intent templates are, there are using more than what is needed.
