# Introducing Version 2

Cocoa Discord Utils Version 2 has introduced many new features

The highlight would be it supports discord.js 14!
Which should open door to lots of fun stuff.

## New Features

- Redesign Class Decorators, noted that Parameter Decorators are not type-safe (meaning if you annonate it with wrong type, it will remain silent), you should be aware when using it.

- Redesigned Activity (Rich Presence) Management

For migration, please refer to [Migration Guide](/introduction/migrate)

*Note that not all changes are noted because I'm lazy and no one really use this library anyway other than me.*
